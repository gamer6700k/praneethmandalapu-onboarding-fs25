##Data: 
I chose to make a heatmap of the track with the speed overlayed as a heatmap because it shows us where the driver is hitting max speeds, 
and we can compare this to a theoretical max and see where they can push the car harder. The graph on the right is very useful to see
if the accumulator is limiting power, which I found out is not the case based on the graph. I built my own electric scooter recently, and
I'd notice that the power would drop drastically at lower SOE, which was what sparked the idea for this graph.
