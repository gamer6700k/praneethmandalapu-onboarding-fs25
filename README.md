##Data: 
The graph on the right is very useful to see if the accumulator is limiting power, which I found out is not the case based on the graph. 
I built my own electric scooter recently, and I'd notice that the power would drop drastically at lower SOE, which was what sparked the idea for this graph. 
But, based on what the graph is showing, even at lower SOE/Voltage, we're able to hit peak speeds. It would be cool to get max kw discharge at each voltage level,
which I plan on making when I get some more time. For the track heatmap on the left, I chose to make a heatmap of the track with the speed overlayed as a heatmap because it shows us where the driver is hitting max speeds, and we can compare this to a theoretical max and see where they can push the car harder.
